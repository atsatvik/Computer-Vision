TIME TRAVEL DAY :  Due to some technical issue with my laptop I am taking three time travel days for this project submission. 


PROJECT 1 : REAL TIME FILTERING

Here in this project following work has been done and implemented:

1) Filter.h - contains all function definitions

2) filter.cpp - contains all functions bodies

3) vidDisplay.cpp - displays a video window that displays live video and a image window that displays the output of live video frame with 		    after filtering (the type of filtering depends on the key pressed).   

4) imgDisplay.cpp - displays an image when the location is given and exits code upon pressing 'q'.

5) In the extension the implemenation of erosion and dilation filtering has been performed where the size of the kernel is 5*5. Press '1' to get dilated image and '2' to get eroded image while vidDisplay.cpp is running.
