# Computer-Vision
Following are all the computer vision projects I successfully accomplished throughout my robotics graduate program:

1. Calibration and Augmented Reality:The objective of this project was to gain a thorough understanding of camera calibration and its significance in computer vision applications. The project aimed to explore the necessity of calibrating a camera before utilizing captured images and provided a comprehensive overview of the calibration process. Additionally, it encompassed the technique of superimposing a 3D object onto a 2D image or implementing augmented reality, with a specific focus on scenarios involving a target, such as a chessboard. Throughout the project, I addressed the challenge of maintaining consistency and accuracy in aligning the 3D object with varying camera angles and target positions. By delving into the intricacies of camera calibration and its practical application in overlaying virtual objects onto real-world images, I enhanced my understanding and proficiency in the field of computer vision. The project provided me with valuable insights and practical experience, allowing me to apply this knowledge to future projects and contribute to advancements in the field of computer vision.
   
2. Content-Based Image Retrieval: In this project, my objective was to develop a content-based image retrieval system. I focused on employing techniques that identify similarities between a query image and a dataset, allowing for efficient filtering of the most similar images. By utilizing pixel manipulation techniques and generating histograms, I compared the histograms using different distance metrics to quantify similarities. Throughout the project, my aim was to analyze and compare the histograms to enhance image search and retrieval based on visual content, reducing reliance on textual information or metadata. By the end of the project, I successfully implemented the content-based image retrieval system, enabling efficient searching and retrieval of visually similar images. This project not only improved my understanding of content-based image retrieval but also sharpened my skills in image processing, feature extraction, and similarity measurement.
   
3. Real-time 2D Object Recognition: In this project, my primary objective was to understand object recognition methods that don't rely on deep neural networks. I explored various techniques for classifying objects based on their unique properties, emphasizing the isolation of objects in images and extraction of distinctive features. I applied this knowledge to compare objects with a pre-existing database. By immersing myself in the project, I developed a solid foundation in object recognition and gained hands-on experience in implementing and evaluating different classification methods. This practical application allowed me to bridge theory and practice, expanding my expertise in image analysis and feature extraction.

4. Real-time filtering: In this project, my core objective was to develop and implement various filters from scratch without relying on OpenCV's pre-existing functions. The project provided extensive learning opportunities and challenged me to apply pixel manipulation techniques to achieve desired outcomes. Additionally, I selected a challenging problem or extension to explore the realm of OpenCV filters and create unique effects. This project allowed me to showcase my expertise and innovation in utilizing OpenCV filters. Overall, it was a valuable learning experience in image filtering and pixel manipulation.

5. Recognition using Deep Networks: In this project, my main objective was to gain a comprehensive understanding of deep neural networks and their impact on computer vision tasks. I explored various topics, including transfer learning, image processing, and the effects of different parameters on network performance. Through practical implementations and hands-on exercises, I developed proficiency in applying transfer learning techniques and leveraging image processing methods to enhance network performance. This project served as an intersection between deep learning and classic computer vision concepts. Overall, the project provided me with a solid foundation in deep neural networks and their application in computer vision. It equipped me with the necessary knowledge and skills to analyze and improve network performance, making me well-prepared for future endeavors in the field.
